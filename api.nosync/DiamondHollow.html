Spawns in the air and flies from wall to wall in a continuous loop.
After a certain difficulty is reached, when the player walks under it, it will shoot a projectile downward.
Also has a lot of health and a high chance of dropping a heart.
You can pretty easily avoid it, but it's a way to replenish health, though risky.
Movement speed, shooting speed &amp; health scale with difficulty.</p>
</section>

      <h4><a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.DHGameComponent.html">DHGameComponent</a></h4>
      <section><p>The base class for all game components, adds a countdown system</p>
<h4 id="countdowns">Countdowns</h4>
<p>Countdowns are timers used to execute a callback function after a certain amount of ticks.
Countdowns are identifed by a numerical id, subclasses can define an enum of countdown names for this purpose.</p>
<p>A countdown is created with the <a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.DHGameComponent.html#DiamondHollow_DHGameComponent_CreateCountdown_System_Int32_System_Int32_System_Boolean_System_Int32_Action_">CreateCountdown(Int32, Int32, Boolean, Int32, Action)</a> method and can be used in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Countdowns can have a callback registered, which is called when the countdown is finished, additional callbacks can be added with <a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.DHGameComponent.html#DiamondHollow_DHGameComponent_AddCountdownCallback_System_Int32_Action_">AddCountdownCallback(Int32, Action)</a>.</li>
<li>The state of countdowns can be checked with <a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.DHGameComponent.html#DiamondHollow_DHGameComponent_IsCountdownDone_System_Int32_">IsCountdownDone(Int32)</a> and <a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.DHGameComponent.html#DiamondHollow_DHGameComponent_GetCountdownProgress_System_Int32_">GetCountdownProgress(Int32)</a> methods.</li>
<li>Countdowns can automatically repeat or be reset manually with the <a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.DHGameComponent.html#DiamondHollow_DHGameComponent_ResetCountdown_System_Int32_">ResetCountdown(Int32)</a> method.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<li>Handles input and randomness.</li>
</ul>
<p>All object in the game are subclasses of <see cref="!:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GameComponent"></see>  and when they are added to this game's components collection,
their virtual methods can be overridden and will be called at specific times automatically.</p>
</section>

      <section><p>Handles animations, taking damage from projectiles and dropping loot on death.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.EnemyController.html">EnemyController</a></h4>
      <section><p>A unified place to spawn all types of enemies.
Doesn't really do much here, but I used this design for other systems in the game, so I used it here as well.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.Foreground.html">Foreground</a></h4>
      <section><p>A class just for rendering the foreground overlay, seperated because each component can only draw at one z-index.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.GameScene.html">GameScene</a></h4>
      <section><p>A class for parenting components to a scene.

      <h4><a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.Level.html">Level</a></h4>
      <section><p>The actual game scene.</p>
<h4 id="platform-textures">Platform textures</h4>
<p>Platform (foreground) textures are handled in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform tiles have connected textures meaning their texture is selected based on the surrounding tiles.</li>
<li>There are 8 surrounding tiles and we only need to know if they are there or not, so we can encode this into an 8-bit integer.</li>
<li>For each combination of surrounding tiles, we want an offset within a tileset pointing to the correct texture (its actualy an array of offsets/textures).</li>
<li>Since all combinations of are possible, we can store this in an array mapping the encoded tile to a list of variations of its texture.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="background-textures">Background textures</h4>
<p>If a checkpoint is activated, background tiles within a radius are illuminated.
This is done by swapping some textures with ore in them for ones where the ore is shining and also by mixing the texture with white.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="DiamondHollow.LevelGenerator.html">LevelGenerator</a></h4>
      <section><p>The map is has a set width and infinite height.
